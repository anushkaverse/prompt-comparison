# 🧠 Prompt Engineering Portfolio – AI Model Comparison (Recursion)

As part of my initiative to explore prompt engineering and response behavior across AI platforms, I conducted a comparison study using a fundamental computer science concept: **Recursion**.

## 📌 Objective

To analyze how different AI models respond to:
- A **generic prompt** → `Explain recursion.`
- A **targeted prompt** → `Explain recursion to a 2nd-year computer science student.`

## 🛠️ Tools Compared

- **ChatGPT** (OpenAI)
- **Claude AI** (Anthropic)
- **Microsoft Copilot**

## 🎯 Key Observations

### 🔹 Prompt 1: `Explain recursion.`

| AI Model           | Style                | Use of Code | Use of Analogy          | Overall Clarity      |
|--------------------|----------------------|-------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| **ChatGPT**        | Clear, layered        | ✅           | Matryoshka doll analogy       | Excellent             |
| **Claude AI**      | Beginner-friendly     | ✅           | plate stack analogy         | Very Good             |
| **Microsoft Copilot** | Dense, direct      | ✅           | book stack metaphor                       | Technical but useful  |

### 🔹 Prompt 2: `Explain recursion to a 2nd-year computer science student.`

| AI Model           | Style                     | CS Context Use | Code Explained | Depth of Response      |
|--------------------|---------------------------|----------------|----------------|------------------------|
| **ChatGPT**        | Contextual, structured     | ✅              | ✅              | Well-balanced           |
| **Claude AI**      | Friendly with CS flavor    | ✅              | ✅              | Intuitive with depth    |
| **Microsoft Copilot** | Technical and brief     | ✅              | ✅              | Less tailored, technical|

## 💬 What This Demonstrates

- How **prompt specificity** alters the quality and tone of AI responses.
- The **interpretation differences** between AI platforms.
- My understanding of **prompt design, AI behavior, and output evaluation**.


## ✅ Why This is in My Portfolio

This study reflects my interest in **Prompt Engineering**, especially in the context of modern AI models used in tech workflows. It was created as part of my internship work with *CodeJR* and demonstrates analytical thinking, clarity in instruction design, and an eye for platform behavior.
