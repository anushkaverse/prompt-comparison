# 🧠 Prompt Engineering Experiments

This document captures my experiments with prompt engineering across three key categories: conceptual explanation, tone adaptability, and creative generation. The focus is on how large language models respond to audience, tone, and phrasing variations.

## 🔁 1. Concept Explanation: Recursion

**Objective:** Test model clarity when explaining recursion to different audience types.

| Prompt                            | ChatGPT                                                                 | Claude AI                                                       | Copilot                                                             |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Explain recursion                | Used Matryoshka dolls and factorial code. Clear and beginner-friendly.  | Plate stack analogy. Precise but slightly abstract.              | Book stack metaphor. Simple yet visual.                             |
| Explain to 2nd-year CS student   | In-depth with call stack & memory. Explained return values in code.     | Covered Fibonacci, call stack, and stack frames.                | Used a family dinner metaphor. Mixed real-world with recursion logic.|

**Takeaway:**  
ChatGPT was more academic, Claude leaned theoretical, and Copilot mixed real-world creativity with tech detail.

## 🎭 2. Tone Adaptability

**Objective:** Observe how models adapt tone (formal vs. casual) while conveying the same idea.

| Tone     | ChatGPT                                                     | Claude AI                                                  | Copilot                                                  |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Formal   | Structured explanation with technical clarity.              | Detailed but slightly verbose.                            | Crisp and direct with coding best practices.              |
| Casual   | Light, humorous, and friendly tone.                         | Conversational and expressive.                            | Used relatable coder lingo. Balanced clarity with fun.    |

**Takeaway:**  
All models adapted tone well. Copilot showed the best balance between friendliness and information.

## 💡 3. Creative Generation

**Objective:** Prompt models to generate creatively by changing tone and audience.

| Variation        | ChatGPT                                       | Claude AI                                     | Copilot                                      |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Wise Monk        | Philosophical with calm wisdom.               | Poetic and reflective.                        | Grounded with earthy realism.                |
| Sarcastic        | Dry humor with subtle irony.                  | Witty with underhanded sarcasm.               | Sassy and exaggerated for comedic effect.    |
| Poetic           | Flowing rhythm with metaphorical touch.       | Rich in imagery and depth.                    | Balanced poetic tone with structured wisdom. |
| Gen Z style      | Casual, emoji-friendly, and upbeat.           | Slightly forced slang, but playful.           | Nailed the tone with Gen Z slang and wit.    |

**Takeaway:**  
Claude excelled in abstract and poetic depth, Copilot led in grounded humor and Gen Z vibes, and ChatGPT remained versatile across styles.

## 📌 Final Analysis

Through these experiments, I’ve explored:

- Varying **audience-specific explanations** (Recursion)
- Shifting **tones between professional and casual** (Clean Code)
- Triggering **creativity through stylistic prompt changes** (Quotes)

These learnings are directly applicable to:
- EdTech content writing  
- Prompt design for chatbots  
- AI tutoring tools  
- Creative writing apps
